	<entityname.mosin>Mosin Nagant</entityname.mosin>
	<entitydescription.mosin>The legend. The myth. The shoulder destroyer. Originally forged during the era of line warfare and bayonets, this 7.62x54r relic continues to serve in the hands of the Jovian Separatists, not out of respect, but because the renegades refuse to fucking throw anything away. It fires a truly massive round with the subtlety of a depth charge, and reloads with the haste of a tectonic drift. Noted for its absurd durability, devastating single shot power, markings dating it back to the Russo-Japanese war of 1905, and a bolt that absolutely refuses to cooperate under pressure. Inaccurate, slow, loud, and older than the submarine you serve on, but still puts holes in things the size of a cafeteria tray. Recommended for: nostalgic grandpas, lunatics, and anyone who thinks "suppressive fire" is a myth made up by weaklings.</entitydescription.mosin>
	<entityname.mosinmagazine>Mosin Nagant Stripper Clip</entityname.mosinmagazine>
	<entitydescription.mosinmagazine>Why are you using this.</entitydescription.mosinmagazine>
	<entityname.mosinauto>Mosin Experimental</entityname.mosinauto>
	<entitydescription.mosinauto>Now fully automatic, because more moving parts is exactly what this rifle needed, and chambered in .50 BMG, because 7.62x54r was "Too pedestrian". With recoil measured in tectonic units, firing it just once voids your health insurance, and the bones in your shoulder too! This ridiculous contraption punches through walls, egos, and probably reality too. Firing this weapon is not recommended in enclosed spaces. Or open spaces. Or at all, without the support of multiples spotters and a back-brace. Nobody knows who built it. Everybody agrees they should not be allowed to build anything again.</entitydescription.mosinauto>
